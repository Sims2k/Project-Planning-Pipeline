# Cursor sub-agents

These agent definitions are used by Cursor as **sub-agents** (custom roles). They appear when you open this project in Cursor so you and your team can invoke role-specific help (e.g. product manager, backend developer, UX researcher).

## Contents

- **Product & strategy**: product-manager, project-manager, business-analyst, market-researcher
- **Design & research**: ux-designer, ux-researcher, ui-developer
- **Engineering**: backend-developer, frontend-developer, solutions-architect, code-reviewer, qa-engineer
- **Documentation**: technical-writer
- **Process**: scrum-master

## Using in Cursor

When this repo is open, Cursor can use these agents from the project’s `.cursor/agents` directory. Ensure your Cursor settings allow loading agents from the workspace.

## Sharing

These files are versioned in this repo so everyone who clones it gets the same set of agents. Edit or add agents here and push; others pull to get updates.
