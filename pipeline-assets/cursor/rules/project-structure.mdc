# Project Structure Rules

## Folder Hierarchy

Every project MUST follow this numbered folder structure:

```
Projects/
  {{Project-Name}}/
    {{Project-Name}} MOC.md     # Required: Central hub
    
    00_Status & Roadmap/        # Dashboards, roadmaps, ADRs
    01_Market Analysis/         # TAM/SAM, competitors, SWOT
    02_User Research/           # Personas, empathy maps
    03_Product/                 # PRD, business canvases
    04_Design/                  # UX flows, wireframes
    05_Technical/               # Tech stack, architecture
    06_Engineering/             # Backlog, sprints
      Sprints/                  # Sprint notes subfolder
    07_Analytics & Growth/      # KPIs, experiments
    08_Legal & Privacy/         # GDPR, privacy
    09_Assets/                  # Images, files
    Archive/                    # Deprecated notes
```

## Creating a New Project

1. Create project folder in `Projects/`
2. Create all numbered subfolders (00-09 + Archive)
3. Create `{{Project-Name}} MOC.md` using `00_Project MOC.md` template
4. Create minimum viable docs:
   - `00_Status & Roadmap/Status_Dashboard.md`
   - `01_Market Analysis/Market_Overview.md`
   - `02_User Research/Persona_Primary.md`
   - `03_Product/Lean_Canvas.md`

## Folder Contents by Stage

| Stage | Required Files | Optional Files |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| 00 | Status_Dashboard.md, Roadmap.md | Decision_Log.md, Roadmap.canvas |
| 01 | Market_Overview.md | Competitor_Map.md, SWOT.md |
| 02 | Persona_Primary.md | Empathy_Map.md, Interview_*.md |
| 03 | Lean_Canvas.md or PRD.md | Business_Model.canvas, Value_Prop.canvas |
| 04 | UX_Flow.md | UX_Flow.canvas, Wireframes.md |
| 05 | Tech_Stack.md | Architecture.canvas, Deploy_Guide.md |
| 06 | Backlog.md | Sprints/Current_Sprint.md |
| 07 | KPIs.md | Experiment_Log.md, Experiment_*.md |
| 08 | — | GDPR_Notes.md, Privacy_Policy.md |

## File Placement Rules

- Notes go in their lifecycle stage folder
- Canvases go alongside their markdown counterpart
- Assets (images) go in `09_Assets/`
- Completed/deprecated notes move to `Archive/`

## MOC Requirements

Project MOC MUST include:
1. Business value hypothesis in `lead` field
2. Quick navigation table to all stages
3. Dataview query for recent activity
4. Dataview query for open tasks
5. Key metrics table
6. External links section (repo, design, analytics)

## Do NOT

- Create projects outside `Projects/` folder
- Skip required numbered folders
- Create notes in project root (except MOC)
- Use non-standard folder names
- Delete the Archive folder
